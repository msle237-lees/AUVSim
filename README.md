# AUVSim

# You will need to grab the obj files from the File Server. If you are not a member of the Kennesaw State Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Team you can contact us in the discord server (link below) to get the files.
Put the files in these folders:
- Assets/Prefabs/Pool/Assets/Pool.obj
- Assets/Prefabs/Robot/Assets/AUV_2024_Model.obj

# The simulation is setup at the current moment to accept controls from an Xbox controller (caused by Shadow PC not accepting other controller support at the Time of Development)
# Plans going forward:
1. Fix the subs bouyancy and get it moving again. 
2. Setup HTTP Post and Get methods to send and receive data (Helpful for training with Python and the Orin)
3. Create the layout for the 2024 competition and code all Prop behaviors.

I plan to have step 1 completed by the end of week (March 23, 2024)
Step 2 will be on hold until the layout for missions have been released by Robosub.
